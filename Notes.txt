Imagine that you are driving down a country road in Texas. 
You see a barn that has six targets painted on it, 
and a bullet hole at the very center of each target. 
“Yes sir,” says the owner of the barn, “I never miss.” 
“That’s right,” says his spouse, “there ain’t a man in the 
state of Texas who’s more accurate with a paint brush.”

# Texas Sharpshooter Example
############################
1992 Swedish health study on powerlines and poor health effects.
The researchers surveyed everyone living within 300 meters of high-voltage 
power lines over a 25-year period and looked for statistically significant 
increases in rates of over 800 ailments.

The study found that the incidence of childhood leukemia was four 
times higher among those who lived closest to the power lines, 
and it spurred calls to action by the Swedish government

The problem with the conclusion, however, was that the number of 
potential ailments, i.e. over 800, was so large that it created 
a high probability that at least one ailment would exhibit the 
appearance of a statistically significant difference by chance 
alone; i.e. the multiple comparisons problem. 

Subsequent studies failed to show any links between power lines 
and childhood leukemia, neither in causation nor even in correlation
